## The Initial Statement

An `if` conditional can have an initial statement.

```plaintext
if INITIAL_STATEMENT; CONDITION {
    // do something...
}
```

## Why Would I use This?

1. It's a bit shorter
2. It limits the scope of the initialized varialble(s) to the if block
   similar to creating a local variable inside the if scope
