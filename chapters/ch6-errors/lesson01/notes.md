# The Error Interface

In Go, `error` is not a primitive type; it is a built-in interface type.

The `nil` value typically signifies the absence of an error when `error` tye is returned.

Rule of the short variable declaration (`:=`) syntax:
it allows existing variables to be included in a multi-variable declaration provided at least one new
variable is being declared.
