## Type Sizes

- Signed types (no decimal)
  `int (same as int64), int8, int16, int32, int64`

- Unsigned integers (non-negatives numbers/no decimal)
  `uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, uintptr`

- Signed decimal numbers
  `float32, float64`

- Complex numbers (a complex number has a real and an imaginary part)
  `complex64, comeplex128`
