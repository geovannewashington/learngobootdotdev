# Interface Implementation

A type never declares that it implements a given interface. If an interface exists and a type has
the proper methods defined, then the type automatically fulfills that interface.

A quick way of checking whether a struct implements an interface is to declare a function that
takes an interface as an argument. If the function can take the struct as an argument, then the struct
implements the interface.
